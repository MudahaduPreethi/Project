            <h2>Agriculture</h2>
            <p><b>Importance</b>  <br>
                Agriculture is a key factor in the rise of human civilization and is a major source of food, livelihood, and economic growth. It's also a powerful tool to end poverty and feed the world's growing population. <br>
                <b>History</b> <br>
                Agriculture in India dates back to the Neolithic period.  <br>
                <b>Products</b> <br>
                India produces a variety of crops, including rice, wheat, maize, jute, sugarcane, pulses, spices, cotton, tea, and coffee. <br>
                <b>Economic impact</b> <br>
                Agriculture is a major contributor to India's GDP, employing more than half of the country's workforce. <br>
                <b>Agricultural projects</b> <br>
                Some examples of agricultural projects include: <br>
                1. Irrigation systems: These systems help optimize water use and ensure consistent crop yields. <br>
                2. Food processing units: These units add value to raw agricultural products. <br>
                3. Improved road networks: These networks help farmers access larger markets. <br>
                4. Rainwater harvesting systems: These systems help build resilience against climate change. <br>
                5.Precision farming: This modern technology enhances the efficiency of agricultural practices. <br>
                Some tips for writing an agricultural project proposal include: <br>
                <b>Identifying the main problem </b> <br>
                1.Determining a solution <br>
                2.Identifying target beneficiaries <br>
                3.Considering resources and budget <br>
                4.Creating a timeline <br>

        <!-- Crop Details Section -->
        <section class="crop-section">
            <h2>Crop Information</h2>
            <p>There are a variety of crops grown depending on the geographical location and climate. These crops are typically categorized into food crops, cash crops, and medicinal crops. Each type of crop requires specific care, irrigation, and fertilization to thrive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Rice:</b>
                    Rice is the chief cereal crop grown in one-third of the world. The ideal environment and conditions for growing rice include high temperatures above 25℃ and high humidity. Rice crops require high rainfall of about 100cm. They usually grow well in fertile and alluvial soil. Rice crops are mainly cultivated in Egypt, India, Sri Lanka, China, and Japan.​
                    </li>
                <li><b>Maize:​</b>
                    Maize is another important food crop. Maize crops require moderate temperate and bright sunshine. The crops require moderate rainfall. The maize crops grow in well-drained fertile soil. Maize is mainly cultivated in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, China, and India.</li>
                <li><b>Wheat:​</b>
                    Wheat is the second most important food crop after paddy. Wheat crops require moderate temperate during the growing season but need bright sunshine at the time of harvest. The crops require moderate rainfall. Wheat crops grow well in well-drained loamy soil. Wheat is mainly cultivated in Canada, the United States of America, Argentina, Russia, India, and Australia.
                    </li>
                <li><b>Sugarcane: </b>
                    Sugarcane is the world’s largest produced crop, and India is the world’s 2nd largest producer of sugarcane after Brazil. It is a tropical grass that attains a length of 10 to 20 feet. Sugarcane is a Kharif crop and needs a hot and humid climate for growth. It can grow in any soil which can retain moisture. The ideal soil for sugarcane is loamy soil.</li>
                <li><b>Tea and Coffee :</b> 
                    Tea is an integral part of India’s daily routine; from masala tea in Kashmir in the north to chai in Kanyakumari in the south, every state has its different taste and way of making a unique beverage out of tea leaves. Tea in India is consumed among every age group, and more than 60% of Indians prefer tea to coffee as their drink</li>
                <li>Fruits (e.g., Mango, Apple)</li>
                <li><b>Mango :</b> A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. It originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".</li>
                <li><b>Apple: </b> An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.</li>
